# GeoInfoNet_Levir_CS_Improvements
This project is dedicated to the work Xi Wu et al. (2021) (DOI: 10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2021.01.023) and improvements of its results using modified strategies of learning NN, augmentations &amp; other tricks to reach better cloud &amp; snow segmentation results on Levir_CS dataset remote sensing multispectral images from Gaofen-1.

We reproduce results of the work Xi Wu et al. (2021), using the authors' code: https://github.com/permanentCH5/GeoInfoNet/tree/main and do further studies of training and sampling approaches trying to get better results

We use the same NN (GeoInfoNet) and data, provided by the authors & research the possibilities of improving cloud and snow segmentation quality by changing the training pipeline, add new augmentations and souping ceveral models etc.
